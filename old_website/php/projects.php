			<div class="wrapper_text">
				<h2>Prjects at Key Element Ltd</h2>
				<p> Most of the projects are not live yet and the content is for testing pourposes and client preview.
					The links will be changed when the websites go live.</p>
				<h2 class="sub_heading">Grace Consulting</h2>
				<p> This is a basic Bootstrap website. Design was provided, which I used with Photoshop 
					to get all the details needed to implement it. As all projects I had at Key Element LTD, this website is modular 
					and the client uses the CMS to add the desired content by selecting the appropriate module.
					Also the modules can be relocated on the page by click and drag, changing their order. 
					The navigation is dinamic and it is built by adding, changing or deleting pages in the cms. 
					This website has a blog with news articles on the News page. The articles are being pulled from the database and filtered accordingly.</p>

				<h2 class="sub_heading">Finance Volkswagen Ireland</h2>
				<p> This project is the Finance section of the Volksvagen Ireland website. As all other projects, 
					this is also modular and client has control over adding, editing and deleting pages, as well as the content for the pages. 
					The menu and the submenu are both dinamic, related to the pages and the headings. The submenu will stick to the top of the page 
					and each element is highlighted as active according to the section viewed. This makes page navigation very fast and intuitive, 
					by taking the user to the desired section.</p>

			<div class="wrapper_text">
				<h2 class="sub_heading">Aftersales Volkswagen Ireland</h2>
				<p> This is the Aftersales section of the Volkswagen Ireland website. 
					Unlike the Finance project, the submenu is not related to sections on the page, but to subpages of the curent page. 
					The content is delivered using more complex elements, such as accordions, carousels with video modals and more.</p>

			<div class="wrapper_text">
				<h2 class="sub_heading">Pivotal Defense Solutions</h2>
				<p> This is another fully responsive website but without Bootstrap. For the navigation, 
					I used flexmenu, to be able to hide links that do not fit on resize, or even in full screen if there are too many pages.
					I had to make some changes to the JavaScript code to implement it into my project and it works quite well.
					The website is modular and the menus are also dinamic. For access, the username is 'client' and the password is 'preview'.</p>

				<h2 class="sub_heading">Tom Murphy Car Sales</h2>
				<p> This was my last project at key ElementLtd and it's a fully responsive website with Bootstrap.
				This time I didn't use flexmenu to hide the links that don't fit and isntead I chose to build my own. 
				It involved alot more work, but the result is more stable and easier to implement in any other project, 
				no matter how complex is the navigation. Same as the other projects, it is modular with dinamic menu.
				It has diffe elements to deliver content, such as carousels, gallery, iframes and a customised map. 
				For access, the username is 'client' and the password is 'preview'.</p>

				<h2>Other Projects</h2>
				<h2 class="sub_heading">Final Year Project</h2>
				<p> For the final year project, I have developed a GP patient management 
					system. It is a website created in HTML5 with a CSS3 
					file for the design. I have designed a relational database in MySQL 
					for doctors, patients and staff, with specific functionality, 
					such as making an appointment or giving a prescription. 
					I used PHP for GET data from database and POST methods 
					to input data into database. The website has an animated dropdown 
					menu designed in pure CSS3 and I also included JavaScript with 
					JQuery library for some effects and alerts.
					I used Wamp with Apache and MySQL  to test the server and write SQL queries. 
					For hand coding, I used Komodo Edit and Sublime Text 2. </p>

				<h2 class="sub_heading">Custom Windows Theme</h2>
				<p>This is a custom theme which I modified to have a 3D aspect and all icons are usable. 
					In order to make your desktop look like this, you will need the 
					<a style="text-decoration:none" href="../documents/breed.jpg" target="_blank">wallpaper</a> (right click, save image as), a free application
					 called <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://rainmeter.net/" target="_blank">rainmeter</a> and 2 skins for it. The first skin you need is desk five, 
					 which has the clock and you can get it 
					 <a style="text-decoration:none" href="../documents/deskfive.rar">here</a>, the second skin is alienware 
					 invasion modified by me, which you can get 
					 <a style="text-decoration:none" href="../documents/alieninvasion.rar">here</a>. I will soon upload a video, 
					 showing you step by step how to modify the skin into looking like this or 
					 whatever you want it to look like. You can find tons of cool looking skins 
					 for rainmeter on 
					 <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.deviantart.com/browse/all/?q=rainmeter+skins" target="_blank">deviantart</a> 
					 and they are free.</p>
