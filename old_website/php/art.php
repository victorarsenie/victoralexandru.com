						<h2>Endles Joy</h2>
						<hr style="border-top:2px solid #222">
						<p> we live inside an endless tear<br>
		fouling arround without fear<br>
		dancing under the clearest sky<br>
		knowing in here we'll never die<br><br>

		i kiss you and i hold your hand<br>
		a moment that will never end<br>
		you look at me and kiss me back<br>
		the time is going off the track<br><br>

		we fly away above the clouds<br>
		and realise there are no bounds<br>
		free to do what we have in mind<br>
		and never again to look behind<br><br>

		i take your hand, i lift you high<br>
		you look at me and start to cry<br>
		it is a joy, we start to dance<br>
		we cuddle and we hold our hands<br><br>

		i make a rainbow of your tears<br>
		and every drop will last for years<br>
		will make our world so colourfull<br>
		with crazy games, just wonderfull<br><br>

		together we'll have endless joy<br>
		the time will be a simple toy<br>
		and nothing will make us fall<br>
		nothing at all</p>

						<h2>Dreaming For Real</h2>
						<hr style="border-top:2px solid #222">
						<p> you're far away into the night <br>
		just come to me, we'll make it bright <br>
		a little kiss to take my sorrow <br>
		i'll think of u untill tomorrow <br><br>

		now follow me into my dreams <br>
		the time will shatter when we'll kiss<br>
		the shining stars will sing for us<br>
		our naked feet will touch the grass<br><br>

		to take you in my arms will be<br>
		a sweet and fun insanity<br>
		my mind will fly and set me free<br>
		the time will be like sand for me<br><br>

		i feel the fire in your heart<br>
		it burns and burns and never stops<br>
		i touch, you feel, you kiss, i die<br>
		and live forever in your eyes<br><br>

		my death is nothing but a door<br>
		it takes me straight into your soul<br>
		i keep you warm, i make you smile<br>
		you sing for me your own desire<br><br>

		and even if it's just a dream<br>
		we'll never know, we'll always feel<br>
		we'd touch the sky and never fall<br>
		forever and for all</p>

						<h2>Pain</h2>
						<hr style="border-top:2px solid #222">
						<p> i raise my hand to reach the sky<br>
		the wind is blowing on my hand<br>
		i touch my lips, they are so dry<br>
		and all arround there's only sand<br><br>

		my mind is slipping away from me<br>
		like breaking free from reality<br>
		making things as they should be<br>
		and taking me closer to insanity<br><br>

		breathing is harder and harder<br>
		blinking my eyes feels endless<br>
		the time seems to pass slower<br>
		screaming now would be hopeless<br><br>

		i'm driven away by a thought<br>
		maybe i'm captive in my own mind<br>
		i try to find the right path<br>
		the one to leave all this behind<br><br>

		lifting my arms felt like lead<br>
		nothing is right, nothing i know<br>
		this time i try to move my head<br>
		but it is stuck and won't let go<br><br>

		some things are to be left alone<br>
		i may be punished for everything<br>
		how did i get to this dead zone?<br>
		maybe dreaming...</p>
